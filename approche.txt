Here are some more problem-solving approaches and techniques that you might find useful:

Two Pointers Technique: This approach involves using two pointers to iterate through a data structure such as an array or linked list. It's commonly used in problems that involve searching, sorting, or manipulating elements based on their positions.

Divide and Conquer: This technique involves breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems, solving them independently, and then combining their solutions to solve the original problem. It's often used in algorithms like merge sort and binary search.

Dynamic Programming: This approach involves breaking down a complex problem into simpler overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once. The solutions to subproblems are stored in a table to avoid redundant computations. Dynamic programming is commonly used in problems involving optimization and finding optimal solutions.

Greedy Algorithms: Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum solution. They are used in problems where making the best choice at each step leads to an optimal overall solution, such as in Huffman coding or the coin change problem.

Backtracking: Backtracking is a technique used to solve problems recursively by exploring all possible solutions. It involves making a series of decisions and then backtracking when a decision leads to a dead end. Backtracking is commonly used in problems like generating all possible permutations or combinations.

Binary Search: Binary search is an efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays or lists. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half until the target element is found or the interval is empty. It's a fundamental algorithm used in various applications, including searching and optimization.

Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS): These are graph traversal algorithms used to visit all nodes in a graph. DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, while BFS explores nodes level by level. They are used in problems involving graph traversal, connectivity, and pathfinding.

Randomized Algorithms: These algorithms use randomization as part of their logic to achieve a probabilistic guarantee on their performance. Examples include randomized quicksort and randomized algorithms for graph problems like finding minimum spanning trees.
